# webscrapper
Simple webscrapper in Python + Beautiful Soup

The purpose of this repo is to learn more about webscrapping. As I mentioned above, I used for this task Python and BeautifulSoup. I found some useful resources to test out and learn more, about webscrapping, so here they are :

The page which I decided to scrap for data, is Polish wikipedia page about Polish kings. I saved it in the folder with the python script which scrapped the page and wrote it in the .csv file. From what I learnt, I can say that BSoup is quite nice tool, allowing to decompose html tags and dig deep into it to get the data. For anyone who is new, I would recommend learning a bit about html markup, because reading wiki page html markup before this task was useful enough for me to learn where the specific elements are, and with which class names I should filter html elements, to get data which I wanted.
